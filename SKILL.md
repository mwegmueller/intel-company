# Intel Company - AI Strategy Dashboard

## CRITICAL: TEMPLATE AND ASSETS LOCATION

**BEFORE generating any report, you MUST:**

1. **Find the template** using Glob:
   ```
   Glob pattern: **/intel-company/report-template.html
   ```

2. **Find the output directory** using Glob:
   ```
   Glob pattern: **/intel-company/assets/
   ```
   The output directory is the PARENT of the assets folder (where `assets/` lives).

3. **Verify assets exist**: The `assets/` folder must contain:
   - `artifact-logo-horizontal.png` (header logo)
   - `artifact-logo-vertical.png` (alternate logo)

**The HTML template uses relative paths to assets (`assets/artifact-logo-horizontal.png`), so the generated report MUST be saved in the same directory as the `assets/` folder.**

## CRITICAL: SOURCE LINKS MUST BE CLICKABLE

**Every source in the Sources section MUST be a clickable link with an actual URL.**

During research, you MUST track the actual URLs of every source you use.

## OUTPUT FORMAT

**OUTPUT: Single-file HTML dashboard saved alongside the `assets/` folder**

This skill creates an **HTML file** (not Word, not DOCX, not PDF). The output is:
1. A `.html` file written using the `Write` tool
2. Saved in the same directory as `assets/` folder
3. Deployed to GitHub Pages via `Bash` git commands
4. Opened locally with `open` command

## ALLOWED TOOLS - USE ONLY THESE

1. `Glob` - find the template and output directory
2. `WebSearch` - research the company (run 25-35 searches)
3. `Read` - read the template file
4. `Write` - save the final HTML to the output directory
5. `Bash` - git commands and `open` command only

## FORBIDDEN TOOLS - NEVER USE

- Any tool starting with `mcp__`
- Browser tools
- Chrome extension tools
- Document creation tools
- Shortcuts or workflows

## Overview

The AI Strategy Dashboard is a comprehensive consulting tool designed for enterprise AI strategy development and executive engagement preparation. It transforms a company name and meeting context into an interactive, data-driven HTML dashboard that delivers McKinsey-grade analysis across eight strategic dimensions.

**Core Purpose:** Enable rapid preparation of AI consulting pitches, competitive analysis, and strategic recommendations with verifiable research, transparent methodology, and actionable AI use case identification.

**Output Deliverable:** A single-page HTML dashboard with 8 tabbed sections, embedded charts, source attribution, and methodology transparency—ready for executive presentation or internal strategy work.

---

## Execution Workflow

The skill follows a structured 5-phase process optimized for research depth and analysis quality:

### Phase 1: Parse Input
Extract and validate user input to establish research parameters and meeting context.

**Input Format Examples:**
- "Prepare AI consulting pitch for Apple, C-suite presentation on enterprise AI roadmap"
- "AI strategy analysis for Pfizer, meeting with VP of R&D about clinical trials automation"
- "Competitive AI strategy brief for JPMorgan Chase, internal board meeting prep"

**Extracted Parameters:**
- `{{COMPANY_NAME}}` - Target company for analysis
- `{{MEETING_CONTEXT}}` - Role, department, and strategic focus
- `{{SECRET_TOKEN}}` - 8-character random token for unique URL (generated automatically)

### Phase 2: Research (25-35 Web Searches)

Conduct systematic web research organized into 6 search clusters. Each search is executed sequentially with WebSearch tool, results parsed, and URLs stored for source attribution.

#### Cluster 1: Company Profile (5 searches)

2. `{{COMPANY_NAME}} annual report revenue financials [year]`
3. `{{COMPANY_NAME}} CEO leadership team executives`
4. `{{COMPANY_NAME}} products services business model`
5. `{{COMPANY_NAME}} technology stack digital transformation`

#### Cluster 2: Competitive Intelligence (5 searches)
6. `{{COMPANY_NAME}} competitors market share`
7. `{{COMPANY_NAME}} vs [identified_competitor] comparison`
8. `{{COMPANY_NAME}} competitive advantage differentiation`
9. `{{COMPANY_NAME}} industry market size [year]`
10. `{{COMPANY_NAME}} market position ranking`

#### Cluster 3: AI & Digital Strategy (5 searches)
11. `{{COMPANY_NAME}} AI artificial intelligence strategy`
12. `{{COMPANY_NAME}} digital transformation initiatives`
13. `{{COMPANY_NAME}} AI use cases machine learning`
14. `{{COMPANY_NAME}} data analytics infrastructure`
15. `{{COMPANY_NAME}} AI hiring jobs machine learning engineer`

#### Cluster 4: Industry & Trends (5 searches)
16. `[IDENTIFIED_INDUSTRY] AI trends 2025`
17. `[IDENTIFIED_INDUSTRY] digital disruption technology`
18. `[IDENTIFIED_INDUSTRY] regulatory AI governance`
19. `[IDENTIFIED_INDUSTRY] market outlook forecast`
20. `{{COMPANY_NAME}} innovation R&D patents`

#### Cluster 5: Recent Developments (5 searches)
21. `{{COMPANY_NAME}} news announcements 2024 2025`
22. `{{COMPANY_NAME}} partnerships acquisitions 2024 2025`
23. `{{COMPANY_NAME}} earnings quarterly results`
24. `{{COMPANY_NAME}} strategy outlook priorities`
25. `{{COMPANY_NAME}} challenges risks issues`

#### Cluster 6: Meeting Context Specific (3-5 searches)
26-30. Role-specific searches dynamically generated based on {{MEETING_CONTEXT}}
- If meeting with CTO: "{{COMPANY_NAME}} technology priorities cloud infrastructure"
- If meeting with CFO: "{{COMPANY_NAME}} cost reduction efficiency initiatives"
- If meeting with Chief Strategy: "{{COMPANY_NAME}} portfolio transformation strategic priorities"

**Research Execution Rules:**
- Each search stored with timestamp and URL for source tracking
- Results reviewed for relevance (include top 5-10 results per search)
- Company logos, CEO photos, and organizational charts collected where available
- No more than 30 searches unless additional context requires deeper analysis

### Phase 3: Synthesize & Analyze

Aggregate research findings into structured analysis using prescribed frameworks:

## Dashboard Generation & Deployment

### Step 1: Generate Unique Report Token
```bash
date +%s | shasum | head -c 8
```
Store this 8-character token as `{{SECRET_TOKEN}}`.

### Step 2: Read the Template
Read the template file found in the CRITICAL section above using the Read tool.

### Step 3: Create the HTML Content
- Replace all `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` values with researched data
- **PRESERVE all methodology callouts** - update their tooltip text with actual methodology
- **Use actual URLs** for all source items (as `<a href>` tags)
- No external chart library dependencies - all charts are CSS/SVG based

### Step 4: Create Filename
Format: `{company-name}-{token}.html` (lowercase, hyphens)
Example: `novartis-8cea1670.html`

### Step 5: Save the Report (use Write tool - NOT Bash)
Write to: `{OUTPUT_DIR}/{filename}.html`
**IMPORTANT**: Must be in same directory as `assets/` folder for logos to display.

### Step 6: Deploy to GitHub Pages (use Bash tool)
```bash
cd {OUTPUT_DIR} && git add . && git commit -m "Add AI strategy dashboard: {COMPANY_NAME}" && git push
```

### Step 7: Open Locally (use Bash tool)
```bash
open {OUTPUT_DIR}/{filename}.html
```

### Step 8: Return the Shareable URL
`https://mwegmueller.github.io/intel-company/{filename}.html`

### Methodology Callouts
- Every analytical section includes ℹ️ icon with tooltip explaining framework used
- Tab 8 (Sources) provides detailed methodology explanations
- Confidence levels indicated for each major finding

### No Emojis in Report Content
- Only use ℹ️ for methodology callouts (structural, not content)
- No decorative emojis in analysis, tables, or text sections
- Professional tone maintained throughout

### Logo & Branding
- Artifact branding applied consistently across header
- Company logos embedded where available
- Professional color scheme matching McKinsey/consulting norms
